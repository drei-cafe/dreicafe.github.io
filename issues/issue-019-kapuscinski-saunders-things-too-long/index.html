  <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I hope you had a good Christmas and New Year's. For the holidays I went back to the home town, a place which, for the first time in my life, felt a lot like the Shire (idyllic, inhabited by nice folk that distrust adventures) if the Shire's terrain was really dry, you had to drive everywhere, and people were super nervous and also weren't hobbits. Being back in Melbourne is strange, the vibes are a fresh sort of eerie: the streets are kind of empty but not really, the bars are kind of desolate but still operational. Not enough cafes are closed to say &quot;most cafes are closed&quot;! It's as if the city decided to shut itself down but froze, halfway through the process, like an old Macintosh cxomputer. You're the spinning beach-ball thing, rolling across non-responsive terrain. Admittedly, it's kind of cool. Except, lots of things are kind of cool until they go on for a little too long.</p>

if melbourne was a computer it would of course be a 1998 imac. pictured: an analogy for last year's lockdowns, with steve jobs as state premier.</center>

<h2>THE EMPEROR by Ryszard Kapuscinski</h2>
<p>Halie Selassie was Emperor of Ethiopia (1939-1974), while Ryszard Kapuscinski was a Polish journalist, and what the latter did after the was toppled was interview his (newly former) servants and dignitaries for a book named <em>the Emperor</em>; it's an &quot;oral history&quot;, a series of transcribed and compiled monologues intersperced with Kapuscinski's writing. That's all I know about what is surely a complex situation, and I refuse to dive into the internet for more info! A lesson learnt from life is more information is not always good; I like where I am now with this Emperor, and this Kapuscinski.</p>
<br/>

<center class="subtext">
on the left, the Emperor; on the right, Kapuscinski. who would win in a drinking contest? a fight? who smells nicer?
</center>
<br/>
<p>I got this for Christmas and devoured it like my mother's herring and beetroot salad (with gusto, in the space of a couple of days, using my fingers). <em>The Emperor</em> is about people in an absurd place, relating to you the absurd things they did, under the absurd system they lived in, during an absurd time. It's bleak and deeply funny but what struck me most is how you feel you kinda... get them. The courtierst aghast that people complain about famine because that wounds the Emperor's feelings; the servant whose sole job is to slide a pillow under the feet of the Emperor when he sits on a throne (each throne requires a different pillow, it's a complex affair). The guy who runs around the Emperor's dog as it pisses on people's shoes, cleaning them up with a little cloth.</p>
<br/>
<h2>GEORGE SAUNDERS TEACHES US FICTION WRITING</h2>
<p>When I bought George Saunder's <em>A Swim in a Pond in the Rain</em> the lady at the bookshop said something like: &quot;oh, yes, you're going to love this&quot;, and I said &quot;oh you just read it?&quot;, and she said &quot;actually I haven't read it, but I've read his other stuff, he's amazing&quot;, and I said &quot;yea totally he's go good&quot; except I'd only ever read the first page of one of his short stories (I did recall it being decent).</p>
<p>This book has Saunders analysing, and helping us analyse, stories by classic Russian authors: Chekov, Turgenev, Gogol, Tolsoy. The bookshop lady was right: <em>A Swim in a Pond</em> is superb. You read one of these Russian stories (they're in the book); you're not sure just why you liked certain parts; why felt what you felt; what you actually felt. Saunders will help you! He points out the shadowy engines at work, muses about writing and reading, gives you a pep-talk to boot. He's your large and mightly father figure! He's holding your hand; you wander through a musty cave/abandoned house; he's got the flashlight and wears masculine perfume. I'm being stupid about it, but <em>A Swim in a Pond</em>  is wonderful.</p>
<center>

</center>
<center class="subtext">
also he is terrifically handsome</center>
<p>Saunders is now doing an online newsletter called <em>Story Club</em> on popular newsletter platform Substack. In it he does similar &quot;writing advice and story analysis&quot; to <em>A Swim in the Pond in the Rain</em>, except it comes to your email-box, it's not Russian stories, and people can comment. If you are interesting in writing fiction, I think it's a terrific resource: Saunders seems happy with it, people love it, it looks very useful.</p>
<p>However — I get weird vibes from it! The precice feeling I have is of Saunders and I and a host of invisible atendeees are inside a glass sphere. It's a roomy sphere; there's plenty of space to move; but the glass is thick and keeps us trapped. The floor is creaky. Saunders moves on tip-toes, as not to distrub the family living beneath.</p>
<p>Why? Do I fear anything on the public internet with comments is ever-scrutinised by a panopticon? Do I suspect things aren't being said that should be said; is it the stop-start newsletter nature I dislike? Is it the &quot;remember everyone this is just my personal opinion&quot; hedging that Saunders oft succumbs to? (I'd like to highlight that every opinion I state is not my personal one, but is objectively correct forever). If I had to guess, it's because all Substack newsletters have the same font and ugly design. Yuck!</p>

<h2>THE PROPER DURATION OF THINGS</h2>
<p>While certain things go on for too long (e.g. this virus I hear is going around), other things don't go for long enough. Here's a list of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>When I was an undergrad student in the aforementioned home town, the place to be was The Original Pancake Parlour, a 24-7 pancake place that did milkshakes and was down a cute alley. It's spawned a dozen chains in Melbourne; I read a Reddit thread about them this morning, in which a former employee claimed they use store-bought pancake mix (80c a box) to make their pancakes, while charging you twelve bucks for a pair. While I can't speak for the chains, the vibe of the Original Kitchen is worth any mark-up. It should be open forever.</li>
</ul>
<center>
<a href="/images/season2/pancake1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/images/season2/pancake1.jpg" width="250px;"/></a>
</center>
<center class="subtext">
when u die, if u lived good, this is what u see </center>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Another place to be in the aforementioned home town (both in the past, and currently) is a chain of vaguely Greek cafe/restaurants called Cafe Primo (&quot;Primo Quality, Primo Price&quot;). Back in the day, when you saw a movie at Hoyts Cinemas, you'd get a voucher for two free pancakes there! I can't remember how those pancakes compared; actually I used to be really nervous going in as a 15 year old because it was so <em>fancy</em> and <em>adult</em>. People drank cappucinos, the height of luxury. The benches were leather. It took a while before I stopped feeling an elegant waiter was about to come over and whisper &quot;there's been a mistake sir, you obviously don't belong here, yonder is the door&quot;. Live forever, Cafe Primo!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basically anything else that's a bit shit but still workable, and you can have a good time at, is a candidate for forever-life because it's a blank slate for good times. I am all for having a good time on one's own agenda. It's more satisfying having a good time in a place that's just kind of there, and kind of shit, than having a good time at a place that really wants you to have a good time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps last year felt like didn't want some of us to have a good time (or perhaps it did, maybe your year rocked) but I hope you squeezed it in regardless!</p>
<p>Have a good time now please.</p>
<p>Bye,</p>
<p>Drei</p>
