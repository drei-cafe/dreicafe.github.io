  <p>_abotu getting co</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The other day, my mum asked me what I want for Chirstmas, a difficult question now, but my favourite quiestion to be asked when I was ten: I'd complied a long mental wish-lish of options because I spent each Thursday afternoon, while Mum &amp; Dad did the shopping, at a dinky newsagent reading computer game magazines &amp; memorising the good reviews. Cheers to the staff for letting me use their shop as a library, I'm still not sure whether that was normal.</p>
<p>Christmas in Australia, if you're a fresh arrival from Russia like I was, is shocking. The season of snowball fights, Grandfather Frost's gifts, and aspic with horseradish becomes the season of sheltering in shopping malls to take advantage of their air conditioning, hearing the same carols on loop, spending Christmas in a sad dried-out park missing Granpda. Which computer game becomes your escape from sunburt reality of Januray, then, is crucial! You could end up hiding from the summer heat in the magic world of <em>Heroes of Might and Magic</em> or you could have the bleakness of <em>XXX</em> for company.</p>
<p>I look on back on a l like an elderly retired wrestler looks back on his glory years from a ranch rocking-chair, also the wrestler no longer cares for wrestling: I've played exactly two computer games in the last two years, and I secretly wished they'd just been books. A certain magazine in that newsagent, though, will be part of me forever.</p>
<h1>LOST MAGAZINES OF INNOCENT YOUTH</h1>
<p><em>PC Zone</em> was a &quot;limey Brit&quot; magazine, full of The Queen's humour â€” when I encountered it, my English skill had just reached the stage where I kina understood most nuance and jokes (reason #239 why reading is cool: if you don't understand a joke while watching a show with friends, you nevertheless feel obliged to laugh, but the grave silence of text will never judge you). Also, while I did not know what &quot;bollocks&quot; or a &quot;naff&quot; were, I could piece it together! I just re-read a scan of the one issue I had, and while it holds up, I reckon there's a great loss to fully understanding things. When you only half-get stuff, your imagination fills in the blanks anf the world becomes a lot more fantastic. It's healthier to not know what &quot;bollocks&quot; is!</p>
<pic1>
PC Zone is a shining example to all writers and that's not my questinable taste talking, the creator of Black Mirror was a regular contrubutor! When a "Zoner" (my just-invented name for their writers, it rhymes with "boner" on purpose, they would want it that way) reviews helicopter and submarine games, he gives you paragraphs of military history; fake interviews; constant jokes about dicks. A Zonner will do funny impressions, poke fun at the French; sometimes the editor jumps in to insult of the writer ( _Like this, you naff bollock_ - Ed ). A section of "budget game" reviews helps those those with empty purses! 
 <pic2>
<p>The articles are good, too: one writer bemoands poor Artificial Intelleigence in strategy games; another critiques the UK government's  anti-pornography legislaion. A bloke called &quot;The Boggit&quot; runs a mailbag where you mail in for game tips! Someone even calls the Spice Girls a &quot;a bunch of air-headed right-wing bimbettes&quot; for giving an interview to conservative magazine <em>The Spectator</em>.  What I would give to travel back in time and sit at PC Zone's cocaine-strewn desks!</p>
<p><pic2> this one is ab out the web and how its boring, which it was compared to the illicit pleasures of the wider web, as outlined in Drei Cafe 13</p>
<!-- Australia had a mag, too. It was called PCPowerPlay, it bored me to bits, dry like sand. Almost as bad as Meanjin. -->
<h1>HORRIFIC VIOLENCE OF THE DECADENT GODLESS WEST</h1>
<p>There were console magazines, too, one was called <em>Sega Power</em>. It gave me nightmares; allow me to state it was filth and I have nothign for it but contempt! In <em>Sega Power</em>, see, you had a &quot;send us your artwork&quot; section, and 99% of the artwork was graphic violent scenes in which characters from Sega violently murdered characters from Ninendo. We're talking: Mario dismembering Sonic with a chainsaw; Tails pumping poison gas into a prison where Luigi begs for mercy. Un-talented children artist thrusting upon their peers graphic depctions of senseless violence! I dimly recall a Nintendo magazine doing the same but can't find a scan to confirm so it gets off for now.</p>
<p>I remember seeing it for the first tinme being so genuinly confused, sad, hurt. Wouldnt video game characters 't just be freinds? Why would they be enemies just because they came form differnet consoles; what do characters care about consoles? Also, they were good, so why would they kill one another? yes, even as a child I knew I was looking at hateful despicable lies.</p>
<p>In Russia, we had gaming mazines where kids sent in drawing of charactres being happy, and also there was was a great section where kids would make up their own video games. They'd write in to explain the backstory and the levels. &quot;Boort and Birt are brothers in a sandy kingdom, and when their sister Barta is kidnapped by a Pterodactyl...&quot; &quot;...level 3 takes place in a tank factory, where the player must jump over spinning blades....&quot;. I don't undesrtand how the collapsing chaos of the Russian 90's produced magic like that, while the economic powerhouse of UK produced the rotting filth of <em>Sega Power</em>.</p>
<h1>MERRY CHRISTMAS WITH GK CHESTERTON</h1>
<p>I went through a teen phase of hating Christmas, mercifully it was short, now I'm over 30 so I'm allowed to unironically enjoy it again. A</p>
<p>Last issue I told everyone not to read Nietzche at the beach, a</p>
